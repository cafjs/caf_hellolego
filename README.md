## Hello Lego

An example app to interact remotely with a Lego Bluetooth hub and a 3x3 color LED matrix.

It relies on a web app in your (Android) phone, and a Reverse Service Worker (RSW) in the cloud, to export the Lego device safely.

It can also provide VR and AR views using WebXR, and keep them in sync with reality.
